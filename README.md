## Mohammed 'Kabir (lekandev),
I am a Software developer currently exploring creative development.

I use **JavaScript, React, NextJs, React Native and Node**.

I tend to have major, original ideas to create the next big thing 🙂.

```javascript
const lekandev = {
                 title: 'Software Developer',
                 age: 19,
                 stack: 'Nextjs, Nodejs, React Native'
}
```
