## Mohammed 'Kabir (lekandev),

I am a Software developer currently exploring creative development.

I use **JavaScript, React, NextJs, React Native and Node**.

I tend to have major, original ideas to create the next big thing 🙂.

```typescript
let lekandev: object = {
  title: "Software Developer",
  age: 19,
  stack: "Nextjs, Nodejs, React Native",
  learning: ["Rust", "Go", "C++"],
  others: ["Astro", "Nuxt/Vue", "React"],
  interests: ["Physics", "Embedded systems/Robotics", "Art direction/design"],
  topProjectAtm: [...allPrivateProjects],
};
```
